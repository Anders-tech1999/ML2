EXE 7 RF - Boston - EGRESSION PROBLEM
- In the lab, we applied random forests to the Boston data using mtry = 6 and using ntree = 25 and ntree = 500. Create a plot displaying the test error resulting from random forests on this data set for a more comprehensive range of values for mtry and ntree. You can model your plot after Figure 8.10. Describe the results obtained.

EXE 8 Regression tree and bagging - REGRESSION PROBLEM
- In the lab, a classification tree was applied to the Carseats data set after converting Sales into a qualitative response variable. Now we will seek to predict Sales using regression trees and related approaches, treating the response as a quantitative variable.
- (a) Split the data set into a training set and a test set.
- (b) Fit a regression tree to the training set. Plot the tree, and interpret the results. What test MSE do you obtain?
- (c) Use cross-validation in order to determine the optimal level of tree complexity. Does pruning the tree improve the test MSE?
- (d) Use the bagging approach in order to analyze this data. What test MSE do you obtain? Use the importance() function to determine which variables are most important.
- (e) Use random forests to analyze this data. What test MSE do you obtain? Use the importance() function to determine which variables are most important. Describe the effect of m, the number of variables considered at each split, on the error rate obtained.
- (f) Now analyze the data using BART, and report your results.

EXE 9 - Classification tree - 1070 purchases where the customer either purchased Citrus Hill or Minute Maid Orange Juice. 
This problem involves the OJ data set which is part of the ISLR2 package.
- (a) Create a training set containing a random sample of 800 observations, and a test set containing the remaining observations.
- (b) Fit a tree to the training data, with Purchase as the response and the other variables as predictors. Use the summary() function to produce summary statistics about the tree, and describe the results obtained. What is the training error rate? How many terminal nodes does the tree have?
- (c) Type in the name of the tree object in order to get a detailed text output. Pick one of the terminal nodes, and interpret the information displayed.
- (d) Create a plot of the tree, and interpret the results.
- (e) Predict the response on the test data, and produce a confusion matrix comparing the test labels to the predicted test labels. What is the test error rate?
- (f) Apply the cv.tree() function to the training set in order to determine the optimal tree size.
- (g) Produce a plot with tree size on the x-axis and cross-validated classification error rate on the y-axis.
- (h) Which tree size corresponds to the lowest cross-validated classification error rate?
- (i) Produce a pruned tree corresponding to the optimal tree size obtained using cross-validation. If cross-validation does not lead to selection of a pruned tree, then create a pruned tree with five terminal nodes.
- (j) Compare the training error rates between the pruned and unpruned trees. Which is higher?
- (k) Compare the test error rates between the pruned and unpruned trees. Which is higher?

EXE 10 - focus on Boosting (and comparison with linear regression, lasso and bagging) - think its numeric
- We now use boosting to predict Salary in the Hitters data set.
- (a) Remove the observations for whom the salary information is unknown, and then log-transform the salaries.
- (b) Create a training set consisting of the first 200 observations, and a test set consisting of the remaining observations.
- (c) Perform boosting on the training set with 1,000 trees for a range of values of the shrinkage parameter Î». Produce a plot with different shrinkage values on the x-axis and the corresponding training set MSE on the y-axis.
- (d) Produce a plot with different shrinkage values on the x-axis and the corresponding test set MSE on the y-axis.
- (e) Compare the test MSE of boosting to the test MSE that results from applying two of the regression approaches seen in Chapters 3 and 6.
- (f) Which variables appear to be the most important predictors in the boosted model?
- (g) Now apply bagging to the training set. What is the test set MSE for this approach?

EXE 11 - focus on Boosting - Binary classification problem - 5822 real customer records, (Purchase) indicates whether the customer purchased a caravan insurance policy.
- This question uses the Caravan data set.
- (a) Create a training set consisting of the first 1,000 observations, and a test set consisting of the remaining observations.
- (b) Fit a boosting model to the training set with Purchase as the response and the other variables as predictors. Use 1,000 trees, and a shrinkage value of 0.01. Which predictors appear to be the most important?

# 12.5 XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin 2016) 
########################################
#   * It is similar to Gradient Boosting, but even more efficient 
#   * eXtreme Gradient Boosting (regularization to prevent overfitting + 
#     an efficient implementation: While regular gradient boosting uses the 
#     loss function of our base model (e.g. decision tree) 
#     as a proxy for minimizing the error of the overall model, 
#     XGBoost uses the 2nd order derivative as an approximation 
#  
#   * It is very popular in data science 
#   * It is consistently used to win machine learning competitions on Kaggle ð
#   * xgboost is a very effective implementation of an old idea coming 
#     from Adaboost and gradient boosted trees


#   * xgboost - the tuning parameters are similar to those of RF and Boosting,
#     but it introduces some new parameters
#   - Number of Boosting Iterations (nrounds, numeric) - the number of decision
#      trees (i.e., base learners) to ensemble 
#   - Max Tree Depth (max_depth, numeric)-depth of a tree (default:6,typical:3-10)
#   - Shrinkage (eta, numeric) - reducing contribution of subsequent models by 
#      shrinking the weights (default: 0.3, typical: 0.01-0.2)
#      Learning rate or shrinkage controls how much each tree contributes to the
#      overall model, with smaller values leading to more conservative updates 
#      and larger values leading to more aggressive updates.
#   - Minimum Loss Reduction (gamma, numeric) - specifies a minimum loss 
#      reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree
#   - Other regularization parameters (lambda and alpha, numeric)- 
#      correspond to L1 and L2 regularization; setting both of these to greater
#      than 0 results in an elastic net regularization; 
#   - Subsample Ratio of Columns (colsample_bytree, numeric)- fraction of features 
#      to be sampled randomly for each of the trees (default: 1, typical: 0.5-1)
#   - Minimum Sum of Instance Weight (min_child_weight, numeric) - minimum sum 
#      of weight for a child node; protects overfit (default: 1)
#   - Subsample Percentage (subsample, numeric) - fraction of observations to be
#      sampled randomly for each of the trees (default: 1, typical: 0.5-1)


#   * Here an application with "xgboost" package 
#   * NOTE:when using xgboost package it requires some data preparation:
